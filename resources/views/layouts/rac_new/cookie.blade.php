            <h5 class="text-orange-4 pull-right">Updated: 23 May 2020</h5><br><br><br>
			
            <p align="justify">This Cookie Policy works alongside our Terms & Conditions. The purpose of this policy is to describe what cookies are, why we use them, and how you can manage them during
			your visit to or use of our website.<br>
			<br>
			The new European Cookie Law makes it clear that the use of the cookie consent kit is
			mandatory on each page of the European Commission web presence, regardless of the cookies
			used. The requirement is essentially that cookies can only be placed on machines where the
			user or subscriber has given their consent.<br>	
			<br>
			More information on the new changes can be found <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htmhere" target="__blank" style="color:#b91900">Here</a>

		 <h4 class="text-orange-4 ">South African Context</h4>
					<p align="justify">The South African POPI (Protection of Personal Information) Act does not explicitly
		mention cookies, but POPI applies because:<br>
		<ul>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> a cookie can contain personal information,</li>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> the definition of personal information includes an online identifier, or</li>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> one of the duties of the Information Regulator is to monitor the use of unique
			identifiers (which includes cookies).</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		The personal information that is processed using cookies will be protected by POPI. Once
		POPI commences, the Information Regulator may publish regulations to regulate the use
		of cookies in South Africa. Generally speaking, POPI is an opt out law, but South Africa
		will probably follow the EU ePrivacy Directive and require the user (or data subject) to
		consent to a website owner using cookies.</p>

            <h5 class="text-orange-4 ">What are cookies?</h5>
            <p align="justify">	Also known as browser cookies or tracking cookies, cookies are small, often encrypted text
files, located in browser directories. They are used by web developers to help users navigate
their websites efficiently and perform certain functions. Due to their core role of
enhancing/enabling usability or site processes, disabling cookies may prevent users from
using certain websites.</p>
			<br>
            <p align="justify">Cookies are created when a user's browser loads a particular website. The website sends
information to the browser which then creates a text file. Every time the user goes back to the
same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website's server. Computer
Cookies are created not just by the website the user is browsing but also by other websites
that run ads, widgets, or other elements on the page being loaded. These cookies regulate
how the ads appear or how the widgets and other elements function on the page.</p>
			<br>
            <h5 class="text-orange-4 ">Why do we use cookies?</h5>
            <p align="justify">These files serve a number of useful purposes for you, including:<br>
		<ul>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> granting you access to restricted content;</li>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> tailoring our website’s functionality to you personally by letting us remember your
			preferences, location or device type;</li>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> improving how our website performs;</li>
			<li>understanding who our audience is so that we can provide content most relevant
			to you;</li>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>allowing third parties to provide services to our website; and</li>
			<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>helping us deliver interest-based advertising where appropriate in compliance with
			the applicable laws.</li>
			</p>
		</ul>
			<br>            
			<h5 class="text-orange-4 ">Cookie security and privacy issues</h5>
            <p align="justify">Cookies are NOT viruses. Cookies use a plain text format. They are not compiled pieces
of code so they cannot be executed nor are they self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot
make copies of themselves and spread to other networks to execute and replicate again.
Since they cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the standard virus definition.
</p>
			<br>	
            <p align="justify">Cookies CAN be used for malicious purposes though. Since they store information about a
user's browsing preferences and history, both on a specific site and browsing among several
sites, cookies can be used to act as a form of spyware. Many anti-spyware products are well
aware of this problem and routinely flag cookies as candidates for deletion after standard
virus and/or spyware scans. See here for some privacy issues and concerns.</p>
			<br>
            <p align="justify">The way responsible and ethical web developers deal with privacy issues caused by cookie
tracking is by including clear descriptions of how cookies are deployed on their
site. These privacy policies should explain what kind of information is collected and how the
information is used. </p>
			<br>
            <p align="justify">Most browsers have built in privacy settings that provide differing levels of cookie acceptance,
expiration time, and disposal after a user has visited a particular site. Backing </p>
			<br>
			<h5 class="text-orange-4 ">Cookies we use </h5>
            <p align="justify">MWPF reserves the right, at any time, to modify all or part of the Terms and Conditions.<br>
			Advertisers are advised to consult the Terms to be aware of the changes.</p>

           <p align="justify">We use different types of cookies on our website. Some of these cookies are placed by
			us, while others are placed by our third-party plug-ins, suppliers or advertisers. These
			cookies may be deleted from your device at different times, such as at the end of your
			browsing session (when you leave the website) or after a pre-set amount of time, or they
			may persist on your device until you delete them.
			</p>	
			<br>	  
		  
            <h5 class="text-orange-4 ">We use the following types of cookies on our website:</h5>
		<ul>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> essential cookies – these are cookies that allow our website to perform its
			essential functions. Without these cookies, some parts of our websites would stop
			working.</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>site analytics cookies – these are cookies that monitor how our website is
			performing, and how you interact with it. We use them to know how best to improve
			our website or services </li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> functional cookies – these are cookies that remember who you are as a user of
			our website. We use them to remember any preferences you may have selected
			on our website, like saving your username and password or settings.
			</li>
		</ul>	
			<br>
            <h5 class="text-orange-4 ">Our cookies</h5>
            <p align="justify">You can see the cookies we use in the following table:</p>
			<br>
		<table>
		  <tr>
			<th>Cookie type</th>
			<th>Cookie function</th>
		
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Basic</td>
			<td>Allows our website to perform its essential functions. Without these cookies,
some parts of our websites would stop working.</td>
			
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Analytics</td>
			<td>Monitors how our website is performing, and how you interact with it. We use

			<td>Functional</td>

any preferences you may have selected on our website, like saving your
username and password or settings.</td>
		  </tr>
		</table>	
		
            <h5 class="text-orange-4 ">Deleting cookies</h5>
            <p align="justify">Your internet browser generally accepts cookies automatically, but you can often change
this setting to stop accepting them. You can also delete cookies manually. </p>
			<br>
            <p align="justify">Deleting or no longer accepting cookies may prevent you from accessing certain aspects
of our website where cookies are necessary or because the website forgot your
preferences. </p>
			<br>
            <h5 class="text-orange-4 ">Policy Updates</h5>
            <p align="justify">We may occasionally make changes to this policy. When we make material changes to
this policy, we will provide you with a prominent notice on our website or send you an
email. We may notify you in advance.
</p>
			<br>
            <h5 class="text-orange-4 ">Make sure your browser is updated</h5>
            <p align="justify">If you haven't already, set your browser to update automatically. This eliminates security
vulnerabilities caused by outdated browsers. Many cookie-based exploits are based on
exploiting older browsers' security shortcomings.
</p>
			<br>

            <p align="justify">Cookies are everywhere and can't really be avoided if you wish to enjoy the biggest and best
websites out there. With a clear understanding of how they operate and how they help your
browsing experience, you can take the necessary security measures to ensure that you
browse the Net confidently..</p>
